## Functional Requirements

### User Stories
- As an avid twitter poster, I want to be able to shorten links so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets

- As a twitter reader, I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links, so that I can read interesting content

- if a user is logged in, the header shows the user's email and a logout button

- if a user is not logged in, the header shows a link to the login page and a link to the registration page

  - if user is not logged in: returns HTML with a relevant error message

- /urls/new
  - if user is logged in: returns HTML with the site header, a form which contains (text input field for the original (long) URL plus a submit button)
  if user is not logged in: redirects to the /login page

- /urls/:id
  - if user is logged in and owns the URL for the given ID, returns HTML with: the site header, the short URL (for the given ID), and form (the corresponding long URL plus an update button)
